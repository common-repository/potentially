== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

This WordPress plugin figures out how many new paying customers your business should be getting each month. It's pretty smart. If you are reaching that number, you've done well, if you are not reaching the displayed number, we'll try to help you reach it and in some cases surpass it.

= How does your AI come up with this number? =
The AI looks at hundreds and even thousands of variables to figure out how many new paying customers you should be gaining each month. For example, it takes a close look at all your website content, pages, products, service or shipping areas, language quality, traffic, time on site, bounce rate, backlinks and much more than compares it to competing websites and other data. Seasonal businesses will see their numbers dip off season and rise on season, older businesses will see much more accurate data than brand-new websites.
